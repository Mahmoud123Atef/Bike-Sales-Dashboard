## 🎯Objective:

    🌟Bike Company wants to create a sales report so it can understand its marketing strategy and grow more sales.

## 🎯Data gathering & cleaning:

    🌟 Imported the Excel file and performed activities like removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analyzed format. The first step in any data analysis project is to clean the data. Because the raw data we receive consists of errors which might affect the insights drawn. I checked if there are duplicates or misspelling in the data and now the data is totally cleaned.



## 🎯Data Processing:

    🌟 Then i updated the column called "Marital Status" from being "M" and "S" to "Married" and "Single", the column "Gender" has been updated from being "M" and "F" to "Male" and "Female" as well. I updated a value which is "10+ Miles" in column "Commute Distance" to "More than 10 Miles" so i can rearrange the column in pivot table.



## 🎯Questions asked:

     👉 Compare the sales using a single chart and find the people, locations with the highest sales.

     👉 Who purchased more, men or women?

     👉 What is the age stage which is highly purchasing this company's bike?

     👉 Which Marital status is contributing to maximum sales?

     👉 Determine which kind of people who purchase more, the nearest or the farthest one from work environment?



## 🎯Key insights:

    👉 Middle aged people are the most to purchase the company's bike.

    👉 Men's purchases are slightly more than women's.

    👉 People whose work environment is near purchases more than that whose work environment is further.

    👉 People with higher income purchasing the bike more than that whose income is lower.



## 🎯Conclusion:

  👉Finally based on the insights, to increase sales we can suggest bike's company consider the following:

  💊 We should target customers of ages ranging from 30 to 50.

  💊 We have to make discounts and coupons for that people whose income is quite low.

  💊We have to target people whose work environment is slightly far from their homes by making discounts for example to them.
